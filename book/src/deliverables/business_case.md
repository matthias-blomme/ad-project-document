# Business Case (D1)
The following items need to be covered in detail in the business case document, which consists
of two parts: a “conceptual section” and a “financial section”.

Important note: you are allowed and even encouraged to use AI to finetune and flesh out
your ideas. However, you must keep all the prompts and add them as an appendix to
your business case document.


## Conceptual section

### Your concept/product/service
Here you will detail what your concept is: what are you going to do and build (or provide as a
service)? Make sure to include all the items specified in chapter 5 (yes, you need to cover
everything we’ve listed there). Don’t be restricted to text for this. Illustrate with charts, figures,
whatever you need to get the message across.

Make sure your concept stands out!

In this section you should also explain how you came up with the idea: a short summary of the
design thinking exercise.


### People
In this section, describe the organisation of your company in more detail:

    -   who will do what within the company?
    -   will you be working with freelancers?
    -   are you going to look for additional employees in the near future (or maybe say goodbye
        to specific employees after a specific period of time)?
    -   how are you going to handle all of this?
    -   …


### Risk management
Setting up a project and/or enterprise brings with it certain risks. You will define the most
important risks you might encounter and how you will handle/mitigate them, should they occur.





In your risk management plan, you will define the various risks associated with your project and
how to mitigate (reduce) or eliminate them. How can you avoid the consequences of said risks?

Adria remains a perilous environment (e.g. toxic atmosphere, …). Should the IT systems be
corrupted, there might even be a risk of loss of life. Therefore, you should think carefully about
this aspect of the project.

You will need to define at least two scenarios that might result in a security breach and one that
might result in a system failure.

What data could be stolen? What systems could be impacted? How will you handle this?

You will also need to identify 2 additional risks, bringing the total of risks to review/build an
action plan upon to 5. Per risk, identify its severity, impacts, action plan, etc. Use the tools and
templates provided as part of the Risk Management class to do so.


### Strategic partners
Your Adrian enterprise is not an island: you will work together with other parties, such as key
partners, suppliers, … To a certain extent, you will even depend on them. Therefore, you will
need to identify these parties as well as the required resources provided by them.

How can they help you? Or how can you help each other? Make sure to also think about other
Adrian enterprises (i.e. project groups) that can function as a strategic partner or supplier.


### Marketing & Sales
How will you attract customers & users?

Write down a marketing strategy based on the marketing mix (4 P’s):

   1.   Product: what are the different layers of your product?
   2.   Price strategy: what is the smartest price?
   3.   Place: how will your product be distributed?
   4.   Promotion: how will you spread the word?



### Financial section

#### Financial calculations
We expect you to work out a financial plan for your business in which you estimate the revenue
and the costs. The aim is of course to make profit in the long run, because natural selection of
companies is universal.





The new Earth (since 2064) is unexplored territory, also in the area of accounting and law, so
you can make use of your financial creativity (no taxes on Adria, so this is not equal to tax
evasion!): think of disruptive innovations such as basic income, virtual banks, blockchains,
crowdlending, etc, ..

As a minimum you need a calculated financial plan for 3 years on a monthly basis covering
following topics:

   -   Revenue = P x Q

P = Based on the P of Price in your marketing plan, you can of course combine strategies

Q = This is the most difficult part of the calculation. Try to base your estimates on information
that is as objective as possible. The main goal is that you are credible in front of the investors
and that you are able to defend your numbers. Use comparisons with terrestian examples, use
credible references/market studies, don’t exaggerate, …
You can also make use of different scenarios to make your prediction of the future more
realistic.

   -   Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs

   -   Fixed Costs

            ★ Sum up the necessary investments and calculate the monthly depreciation
            ★ Think of other fixed costs such as electricity, rent, wages, ...

   -   Variable costs

            ★ Variable costs are costs that are dependent on the Q. This is not always easy to
              find but add as a minimum one variable cost to your calculation. (e.g. server
              costs)

   -   Break-even analysis

       Based on your summary of revenue and costs, do the following 2 break-even analysis:

            ★ How much do you have to sell to be profitable?

            ★ When will you be profitable?

   -   Finance mix

       Probably you don’t have enough savings to do the necessary investments, so you have
       to look for external money. Explain your finance mix.








### Appendices
You may add various appendices to support your business case document.

As mentioned earlier, it is mandatory to at least include an appendix with all AI prompts
(ChatGPT, Copilot, …) you used to enhance your ideas.
