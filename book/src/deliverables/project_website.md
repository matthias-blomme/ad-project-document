# Project website (D2)

## About the website
Using a self-hosted instance of WordPress, you will build a website. This website has two parts,
targeted towards two separate audiences:

   -   Public part: presenting yourself as a company to the world
   -   Secured part: this should be a blog, containing your daily standups. Also, a link to your
       deployed application is included.

The website is an integral part of the project assignment. Layout (is everything displayed in a
clear fashion, do you adhere to your company branding, …) and content (relevancy, …) will be
graded, but you are not allowed to code the entire website itself manually using HTML/CSS/JS
or server-side technologies.

There is no need to use paid hosting either.

Tip: use the Combell hosting offered through Academic Software. One project member per
group can register a domain name with associated webhosting through this channel and that
can then be used throughout the project.


## Public part

Basic concept and approach
What will you build and why are you building it?

Get across a clear picture of what your product is and what it’ll do. It is not necessary to go into
as much detail as in the business case document itself. Think about the message you want to
convey to potential customers or investors.

Website page you should build as a result of this exercise:

   -   Home page
   -   Products/services page
   -   About us





Human resources
In this part, you will define the organisational structure of your Adrian enterprise:

   1. How will you be organising your team?
   2. Task distribution: who will do what?

Website pages you should build as a result of this exercise:

   -   Our team
   -   Job offers
   -   Contact us


## Secured part

Blog posts
In the secured part (only accessible using specific login credentials: see below), you should add
a short blog post per daily standup.

Deployed application
There should also be a link towards the deployed version of your application

AI prompts
AI can and should be used to assist in the generation of proper content (text and media) for the
website. Therefore you must keep track of the AI prompts you used and include them in this
section of the secured website.



Login credentials you need to setup:

Username (mandatory): lecturer

Password (mandatory and unique per group): will be communicated to the group members by the
lecturers through automated mail.

You need to include these login credentials in the Gitlab documentation repo’s README (see
earlier).
