# D6: Project work

## PM on Gitlab
All work, communication, deadlines, branching, … needs to be handled on the school’s provided
Gitlab repositories according to the best practices taught in current and past Applied Computer
Sciences classes. If things are rusty, get out your old course material and brush up on your
knowledge in order to comply with our rules.

In the first year, you were handed the milestones (=sprints) and the epics (=user stories). This
year, you will need to create these yourselves in gitlab (on your group level).


## Daily standups
At the start of each project day, the groups should have a "daily standup". You will discuss the
following allocating an average speaking time of 1 minute per person:

   -   What did I work on previously and what is its state (Finished / still in development)?
   -   Did I experience any difficulties with it? If so, which?
   -   What will I be working on today?
   -   Do I expect any difficulties / will I be needing some help with a certain topic?

A team member with expertise in the element in question can already indicate this and can be
an aid at a later stage.

In the project weeks the daily standups take place every day, during the regular class weeks
every Thursday.


You'll need to submit a summary of your daily standup in the secured part of your site as a blog
post. You can choose to either take notes, or record the standup itself and upload it as a video
in the post. Don’t forget to add a title and every post should also have a ‘picture of the day’ with
all the group members. The post should be published at the latest at 10:30am every project day.
