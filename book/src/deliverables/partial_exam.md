# D4: Partial Exam
A Leho quiz which tests if you have enough knowledge of the client will be available on the first
day of the first project week. The questions will focus on Vue.js and push notifications from the
input sessions.

On the same day there will be a server exam in which you will need to add some basic features
to the start code of the server in a structured manner. You must use the Gitlab server of TI to
submit. A start repository will be available.

The quiz and exam are individual. More details about the quiz & server exam are on Leho.
