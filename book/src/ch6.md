# 6. Deliverables: specific requirements

Below you’ll find specific requirements for each of the deliverables listed at the start of this
document.













### Project work (D6)

#### PM on Gitlab
All work, communication, deadlines, branching, … needs to be handled on the school’s provided
Gitlab repositories according to the best practices taught in current and past Applied Computer
Sciences classes. If things are rusty, get out your old course material and brush up on your
knowledge in order to comply with our rules.

In the first year, you were handed the milestones (=sprints) and the epics (=user stories). This
year, you will need to create these yourselves in gitlab (on your group level).


#### Daily standups
At the start of each project day, the groups should have a "daily standup". You will discuss the
following allocating an average speaking time of 1 minute per person:

   -   What did I work on previously and what is its state (Finished / still in development)?
   -   Did I experience any difficulties with it? If so, which?
   -   What will I be working on today?
   -   Do I expect any difficulties / will I be needing some help with a certain topic?

A team member with expertise in the element in question can already indicate this and can be
an aid at a later stage.

In the project weeks the daily standups take place every day, during the regular class weeks
every Thursday.




You'll need to submit a summary of your daily standup in the secured part of your site as a blog
post. You can choose to either take notes, or record the standup itself and upload it as a video
in the post. Don’t forget to add a title and every post should also have a ‘picture of the day’ with
all the group members. The post should be published at the latest at 10:30am every project day.

### Retrospections and peer assessments (D7)
We’ll be posting several retrospections and peer assessment assignments via Leho, which need
to be completed.

### Presentation (D8)
Read and apply the guidelines of the semester 2 presentation techniques course "Beter
presenteren, is dat echt nodig?"

   -   Allocated time for the presentation is 20 mins and an additional 10 minutes question time
   -   Your audience consists of potential investors (private and government). Keep this in
       mind!
   -   Your presentation is in English. Questions can be answered in Dutch.
   -   Your presentation has the same look and feel as your application.
   -   You are free to choose which tools used to build the presentation (i.e. you are not limited
       to powerpoint slides). Conveying the story is the primary objective.
   -   You make sure the presentation is clear and only contains information that is relevant
       and interesting for your audience.

A few more tips:

   -   Everyone participates equally in the presentation.
   -   You bring a coherent story and you try to anticipate the audience's questions.
   -   You have a neat appearance, but don't exaggerate: you must still be yourself to some
       extent.
   -   Your attitude is of course very important; this means no ringing cell phone, no chewing
       gum, being polite, enthusiastic, … .
   -   The way in which you address the public is also important! Greet the investors, thank
       them for their attention and calmly answer questions, even if they may be formulated
       rather directly.
   -   You defend your project if you feel it is appropriate. However, when necessary you admit
       you made a mistake or you admit you do not know the answer to a specific question.
       The following sentence is always helpful in this kind of situation: “I have not yet looked at
       the matter from this point of view but that is certainly a valuable suggestion. (Don't
       overuse it ;).
   -   You use your non-verbal communication correctly and efficiently.

The entire group must participate in the planned trial presentations before the Christmas
leave. It goes without saying that your test presentation is structured according to the guidelines
of the semester 2 presentation techniques course.
