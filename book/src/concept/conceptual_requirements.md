# Conceptual requirements

Your application needs to contain all conceptual requirements below. One requirement may
take a larger focus than another, yet all are imperative. Failure to comply will result in a failed
project!

Carefully consult with your group mentor to assert compliance.

All requirements are specified as generic as possible to optimally serve your imagination. User
stories (in gitlab, on group level) are ideal to organise the way you wish to meet these
requirements


#### Innovative aspect
Key to this new world is that your solution makes the life of the people better in the broad sense
of the word. Learn from the past! Your product must be innovative that improves the quality of
life and well-being of people on earth, big or small.


#### Visualisation component
Medium to large amounts of data need to be presented in a visually attractive way. These can
be immersive gallery experiences, graphs, maps, …

Be creative!


#### User data collection
Your application needs to collect data from the user. Exactly which data, how much and how
you’ll query for the necessary details, is up to you. The data needs to be stored server side, by
means of one or more data stores.

In the POC, you get an SQLite database for your application, but for your concept, you may use
as many different data stores as appropriate.


#### Usage incentive
We need a compelling reason for our users to keep using the application. Intrinsic motivation is
the best kind of incentive, try to find out how for your application.
