# Concept choice process


### Which software system to develop?
The current people on the Adria colony have already put out a list of absolutely necessary
software systems (= Adria’s Critical Apps) to be developed. You can do one of two things:

   1) Develop one of these Adria’s Critical Apps with a pre-set topic
   2) Think of a solution yourself

In the second week every group has to pitch their topic.

If there are competing groups choosing the same topic from the pre-set list, you will have to
pitch your concept in front of a couple of experts, who will determine which group gets to go
ahead. The other(s) go back to the drawing board.

Should two groups accidentally come up with the same/extremely similar software system
concept, those two groups will be pitching against one another as well. The jury will pick the
best concept, the others will also go back to the drawing board.

After the pitches have finished, you will get a GO or NO GO. If you get a NO GO, you should either
be able to choose one of the remaining Adria’s Critical Apps or you can still come up with a
fresh concept.


#### List of pre-determined Adria’s Critical Solutions
   -   AdriaBook:
       Adria connector application (cfr facebook/other social media ) to connect the different
       people of Adria and other colonies. Connections to intergalactic citizens are not possible
       (Mars and space station). Earth only.

   -   Adria Rover rental:
       Rent a rover, complete with navigation system, designed to easily find your way around
       the surface of the Earth and toward the other colonies. Integration with weather app for
       danger alerts is mandatory. The application comes with a built-in function to simulate
       driving with the Adria rover and learn how to handle it before taking it out in the field.

   -   24/7:
       Collection app for all events on Adria, what’s happening, when and where (and are you
       invited?)

   -   Mapp Store:
       Adria’s App store, collecting all available applications for AdriaOS devices






   -   Are you the Adrian I’m looking for?:
       Looking for a person with a certain skillset? Perhaps he can do a job for you or vice-
       versa? An upscaled linked-in with instant work opportunities. Think about constraints in
       this new environment. If a person needs to go under the colony or to another one,
       transport needs to be arranged etc.

   -   Adria’s Auction House
       Produced/minded (and other) materials are available to all creative people of Adria. The
       auction house is the entry point to sell and buy Adria’s materials. Since the Adria’s
       community has a focus on sustainability, restoring/saving resources, this can be
       extended with suggestions for optimization of materials use.

   -   Adria Exchange:
       The Adria’s stock exchange. All these new companies building all these new products
       will probably be looking for investors. Develop a market place of them to trade, based on
       Terran stock markets though creative deviations are allowed.


#### Inspiration

There are plenty more today’s Earth based applications you can modify to Adria’s needs that
haven’t been listed above (Fitbit, find that person instead of that device, …) but nicer would be to
look at things from an Adria’s perspective and truly focus on what this new society needs.

Maybe you can think along the lines of applications such as a person’s impact on Adria
(everything from your excretion to how many plants you fertilise by it..). Colonisation requires
progeny, how will we handle coupling? Is a Tinder / Grindr clone what we’re looking for or can
we match people in a different way? Can you integrate the physical world into it?

What about the world around Earth? Maybe there are deepsky objects that require our attention.
What value would they have? How do we connect with the people on Mars?

Maybe we want to rethink currency. Who says money has any value? What *does* have value on
Adria and how will you leverage it?

What about policing and community voice? Does this have to be a democracy? Can we
organise society in a different way and have technology support this? Maybe an AI can
determine the fate of an offender. Experiment, brainstorm, think!

Do not find yourself constrained by current technological limitations and assume the tech can
handle it. If you can think of it, it’s possible (with the exception of time travel, inter-dimensional
travel and zombies – we are not yet in the year 3000).
