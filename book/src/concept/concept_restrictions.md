# Context - restrictions

The year is 2084.

After starting colonisation on Mars in the fifties, disaster has struck Earth. A series of
catastrophic disasters led to an apocalypse in 2064 in which most of the population became
extinct. Some were still able to emigrate to Mars (current population of Mars: 7 500 000), while
others were evacuated by spacecrafts, The Titanic Spaceships (each carrying 20 000
passengers and crew). In 2068, a group of pioneers returned to Earth and started rebuilding. In
doing so, they faced a number of challenges: sea level rose by 2 metres, only solar energy, clean
water is scarce, ... Yet, ten years later, they managed to allow colonisation again on a place
called Adria. Meanwhile, there are already 100 000 inhabitants on Ardia and they are ready for
full expansion.

Your task is to think of a product that will enhance Adria’s lives and serve as a way forward to
shape a new civilisation on our blue planet.

Mind you that we are focusing on reshaping civilisation as we know it. On Adria, we get a fresh
start. It is not bound by Terran laws. The only law that is in effect, is maritime law 1.

The Aether Council serves as the guardian of fundamental rights and ethical principles in the
newly colonized world of Adria. Comprising wise leaders and visionaries, the Council is
dedicated to ensuring justice, preserving individual freedoms, and fostering a harmonious
society. Through thoughtful deliberation and guidance, they aim to protect humanity's dignity
and promote sustainable coexistence in this new era.

Your company, product, service - or all of the above - has the power to attribute to this new way
of living and create a better version of humanity.




1
  Maritime law states that land cannot be owned, it belongs to the whole of the community. However,
whatever is on or within the land can (i.e. mining, foraging, …). The owner of the resources has the right
to defend his possessions with necessary measures.






### Earth: current settlements in 2084

#### The Entry Station


                                                              The Entry Station is the single point
                                                              of entry for all lifeforms seeking
                                                              residency on Adria, the first colony
                                                              on Earth since the Global Disaster.
                                                              There is a crew manning the station
                                                              around the clock, but otherwise it is
                                                              largely populated by “passer-by”s.

                                                              Quarantine procedure will require
                                                              people to stay for a short period of
time, both traveling on and off-planet. This means you’ll get a short engagement from many
users, but never for more than a couple of weeks. The range of people reached with any type of
advertising is highest here.


#### Adria: the First colony
                                                            Adria, the First colony is where the
                                                            magic’s at. This fully-operational
                                                            colony is a small indicator of what life
                                                            will be again on Earth.

                                                            Complete with extensive medical
                                                            facilities, schools for the youngest,
                                                            lush greenhouses, robuust research
                                                            lab and extensive R&R amenities, this
                                                            is the heart of Earth. There is need for
                                                            expansion and diversification. The
                                                            colony is looking for new souls and
                                                            ideas to shape the Adria’s identity.








#### The Other colonies
                                                  Where Adria is fully operational, other colonies
                                                  around the world are built to obtain the same
                                                  objective. For now, those places are under
                                                  construction.

                                                  People stay there for extended periods, lacking all
                                                  the comfort from Adria, only the basic needs
                                                  provide, sometimes for months. Work is the main
                                                  focus of the populace, with medium breaks for
                                                  much needed R&R 2, after travelling by the Earth
                                                  Voyager to the Adria Colony.




#### Relations between settlements
Each settlement has their own type of residents as well as general line of activity and “type” of
environment. It is imperative you take these into account when creating your product/service.

### Conventions and terminology
You may assume the following about current Adria’s life:


#### AdriaOS - One OS to rule them all
Do not concern yourself over compatibility between devices. There is one OS to rule them all,
AdriaOS, which supports all resolutions for Adria’s approved devices. The hardware across
these devices is consistent.


#### Adria’s devices
All people (on Earth, on Mars, on the space station) have an implanted chip that is used for
identification and monitoring (vital signs, localization, …).

Upon arrival all Adrians are given a device which can project an interactive interface of any size
on any surface (or even lacking surface). They can also act as a trigger to activate nearby
sensors to interact with the environment. It comes in the shape of a wristband, with the
projection unit on top.


#### AdrianID
Every Adrian has an ID integrated into their chip and connected wristband. The individual’s
identity is validated upon arrival and encoded into the chip. As a result of this, all applications in
the Adrian environment are required to use AdrianID for authentication. Registration or Login
forms are forbidden by Adrian law!


#### Currency: the AdriaCoin
All currency on Adria is handled via the blockchain-based AdriaCoin (ADCO). For calculations
you can use the conversion of 1 ADCO = 1 EURO.
