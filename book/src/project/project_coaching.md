# Coaching

There are two types of coaches who will assist you: group mentors and topic experts

### Group mentor
Every group will be assigned one group mentor, who will monitor the group's progress
throughout the semester. The group mentor is your point of contact for all non-technical
questions. Disputes, conflicts,... also need to be reported to the group mentor. If there is a group
member that does not perform adequately, this information needs to be submitted timely to the
group mentor, so that s/he can attempt to remedy it. 3 weeks before the project ends is NOT
timely.


#### Summon by group mentor
The group mentor will summon the group on a regular basis to confer. You can interchange
ideas, planning, and possible approaches. If there are questions that are too technical, the
mentors will relay them to a topical expert.

A summon by the group mentor is a mandatory moment on which every group member's
presence is required. Failure to comply will negatively impact your score. The summoning can
happen at any time during the week from Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm, it does not
have to be on the allocated project working time. You will be notified at least three hours prior
to its occurrence.

### Topical experts
The topical experts will handle your technical questions in their area of expertise. A schedule
will be published with each expertâ€™s skillset and availability. Make sure you plan your questions
carefully, as not every expert will be available at all times.
