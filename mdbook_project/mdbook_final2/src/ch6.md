# 6. Deliverables: specific requirements

Below you’ll find specific requirements for each of the deliverables listed at the start of this
document.

### Business Case (D1)
The following items need to be covered in detail in the business case document, which consists
of two parts: a “conceptual section” and a “financial section”.

Important note: you are allowed and even encouraged to use AI to finetune and flesh out
your ideas. However, you must keep all the prompts and add them as an appendix to
your business case document.


#### Conceptual section

##### Your concept/product/service
Here you will detail what your concept is: what are you going to do and build (or provide as a
service)? Make sure to include all the items specified in chapter 5 (yes, you need to cover
everything we’ve listed there). Don’t be restricted to text for this. Illustrate with charts, figures,
whatever you need to get the message across.

Make sure your concept stands out!

In this section you should also explain how you came up with the idea: a short summary of the
design thinking exercise.


##### People
In this section, describe the organisation of your company in more detail:

    -   who will do what within the company?
    -   will you be working with freelancers?
    -   are you going to look for additional employees in the near future (or maybe say goodbye
        to specific employees after a specific period of time)?
    -   how are you going to handle all of this?
    -   …


##### Risk management
Setting up a project and/or enterprise brings with it certain risks. You will define the most
important risks you might encounter and how you will handle/mitigate them, should they occur.





In your risk management plan, you will define the various risks associated with your project and
how to mitigate (reduce) or eliminate them. How can you avoid the consequences of said risks?

Adria remains a perilous environment (e.g. toxic atmosphere, …). Should the IT systems be
corrupted, there might even be a risk of loss of life. Therefore, you should think carefully about
this aspect of the project.

You will need to define at least two scenarios that might result in a security breach and one that
might result in a system failure.

What data could be stolen? What systems could be impacted? How will you handle this?

You will also need to identify 2 additional risks, bringing the total of risks to review/build an
action plan upon to 5. Per risk, identify its severity, impacts, action plan, etc. Use the tools and
templates provided as part of the Risk Management class to do so.


##### Strategic partners
Your Adrian enterprise is not an island: you will work together with other parties, such as key
partners, suppliers, … To a certain extent, you will even depend on them. Therefore, you will
need to identify these parties as well as the required resources provided by them.

How can they help you? Or how can you help each other? Make sure to also think about other
Adrian enterprises (i.e. project groups) that can function as a strategic partner or supplier.


##### Marketing & Sales
How will you attract customers & users?

Write down a marketing strategy based on the marketing mix (4 P’s):

   1.   Product: what are the different layers of your product?
   2.   Price strategy: what is the smartest price?
   3.   Place: how will your product be distributed?
   4.   Promotion: how will you spread the word?



#### Financial section

##### Financial calculations
We expect you to work out a financial plan for your business in which you estimate the revenue
and the costs. The aim is of course to make profit in the long run, because natural selection of
companies is universal.





The new Earth (since 2064) is unexplored territory, also in the area of accounting and law, so
you can make use of your financial creativity (no taxes on Adria, so this is not equal to tax
evasion!): think of disruptive innovations such as basic income, virtual banks, blockchains,
crowdlending, etc, ..

As a minimum you need a calculated financial plan for 3 years on a monthly basis covering
following topics:

   -   Revenue = P x Q

P = Based on the P of Price in your marketing plan, you can of course combine strategies

Q = This is the most difficult part of the calculation. Try to base your estimates on information
that is as objective as possible. The main goal is that you are credible in front of the investors
and that you are able to defend your numbers. Use comparisons with terrestian examples, use
credible references/market studies, don’t exaggerate, …
You can also make use of different scenarios to make your prediction of the future more
realistic.

   -   Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs

   -   Fixed Costs

            ★ Sum up the necessary investments and calculate the monthly depreciation
            ★ Think of other fixed costs such as electricity, rent, wages, ...

   -   Variable costs

            ★ Variable costs are costs that are dependent on the Q. This is not always easy to
              find but add as a minimum one variable cost to your calculation. (e.g. server
              costs)

   -   Break-even analysis

       Based on your summary of revenue and costs, do the following 2 break-even analysis:

            ★ How much do you have to sell to be profitable?

            ★ When will you be profitable?

   -   Finance mix

       Probably you don’t have enough savings to do the necessary investments, so you have
       to look for external money. Explain your finance mix.








#### Appendices
You may add various appendices to support your business case document.

As mentioned earlier, it is mandatory to at least include an appendix with all AI prompts
(ChatGPT, Copilot, …) you used to enhance your ideas.




### Project website (D2)

#### About the website
Using a self-hosted instance of WordPress, you will build a website. This website has two parts,
targeted towards two separate audiences:

   -   Public part: presenting yourself as a company to the world
   -   Secured part: this should be a blog, containing your daily standups. Also, a link to your
       deployed application is included.

The website is an integral part of the project assignment. Layout (is everything displayed in a
clear fashion, do you adhere to your company branding, …) and content (relevancy, …) will be
graded, but you are not allowed to code the entire website itself manually using HTML/CSS/JS
or server-side technologies.

There is no need to use paid hosting either.

Tip: use the Combell hosting offered through Academic Software. One project member per
group can register a domain name with associated webhosting through this channel and that
can then be used throughout the project.


#### Public part

Basic concept and approach
What will you build and why are you building it?

Get across a clear picture of what your product is and what it’ll do. It is not necessary to go into
as much detail as in the business case document itself. Think about the message you want to
convey to potential customers or investors.

Website page you should build as a result of this exercise:

   -   Home page
   -   Products/services page
   -   About us





Human resources
In this part, you will define the organisational structure of your Adrian enterprise:

   1. How will you be organising your team?
   2. Task distribution: who will do what?

Website pages you should build as a result of this exercise:

   -   Our team
   -   Job offers
   -   Contact us


#### Secured part

Blog posts
In the secured part (only accessible using specific login credentials: see below), you should add
a short blog post per daily standup.

Deployed application
There should also be a link towards the deployed version of your application

AI prompts
AI can and should be used to assist in the generation of proper content (text and media) for the
website. Therefore you must keep track of the AI prompts you used and include them in this
section of the secured website.



Login credentials you need to setup:

Username (mandatory): lecturer

Password (mandatory and unique per group): will be communicated to the group members by the
lecturers through automated mail.

You need to include these login credentials in the Gitlab documentation repo’s README (see
earlier).








### Analysis document (D3)
   The following items need to be covered in detail in the analysis document.

   Important note: you are allowed and even encouraged to use AI to finetune and flesh
   out your ideas. However, you must keep all the prompts and add them as an appendix
   to your analysis document.


#### Scope of product
Determine the scope of the concept of your product using the following tools:

   -   Create at least 3 persona for your concept. For each target group, you create a
       different persona. Don’t forget: persona get a face and an identity, and in so doing bring
       back the human factor into the design process.
   -   Write minimum 4 user stories for each persona. A user story is a short statement or
       abstract that identifies the user and their need/goal. It determines who the user is, what
       they need and why they need it. There is usually 1 user story per user persona per task.
       User stories should be created as epics in gitlab.
   -   Based on the user stories the feature list for your applications is determined. Make a
       MoSCoW list and Feature Priority Matrix to define. Clearly mark in the feature list which
       features will be included in the POC.


#### Schematics
Describe the full concept in a collection of schematics, which can be suited to your needs. We
expect at the very least:

   -   Minimum 3 flow charts for the most common flows a user will have for your solution.
       Mind that we do not want application descriptors (no press this button, then fill out that
       field), but generic actions/choices which span much further than just the interface
       interaction. Interaction is part of it, but not the whole. The level of detail is more global
       (remember Application Prototyping)

   -   A C4 diagramme featuring at least a context and deployables diagramme. You may add
       component diagrammes for the items you find necessary, or omit them all together.
       Remember: the objective here is to get the message across, not to over-document

   -   One or several UCDs based on user stories. Those user stories should be created as
       epics in gitlab. Refer to those from your UCD’s

   -   An ERD describing the information model of the software system







   -   Any other schematic you may find useful to explain the concept. This does not need to
       be anything class-taught. If you find it useful, and it gets the message across, include it.
       Even if it’s concept art. (we like concept art)

Clearly mark on your documentation which elements will be included in the POC.




#### Interactive wireframes and visual designs
The wireframes deliverable will hold interactive wireframes for the full concept, so your
wireframes will be far more extensive than your POC. They are clickable, high-fidelity and
created in Figma (mandatory).

For the visual designs you will use the Material Design system (mandatory). You add the visual
designs to the Figma file of your wireframes.

Depending on your concept, you will need to design several interfaces. You need to create all
necessary interfaces to elaborate your concept.

In 2080, we don’t think in “sizes”, but in “settings”. Most solutions will have a combination of
several settings. We require at least two different settings, but depending on your concept, you
might need more. Make sure you name every interface appropriately.


Consider the following use cases:

Example 1 Bad: Your concept is an event platform. Users can browse and pick events to attend.
Choose a resolution that best fits the information you wish to display to the user.

Wireframe deliverable: A single wireframe, one with the full-fledged event browser, on a
resolution of your choice -> Insufficient!! There’s only one setting here, expand the concept to fit
multiple settings!

Example 1 Good: The concept is the same as above, but your application also offers users a
way to connect with friends during the event. It will display a mini map of the event grounds,
with your friends highlighted, including the route towards them.

Wireframe deliverable: Two wireframes, one with the full-fledged event browser, on a resolution
of your choice (=high focus context in a primary setting) and another for the mini-map interface
(notification-like context in secondary setting)

Example 2: Your concept is an incident logger for maintenance equipment in one of the
subterranean facilities. There are two settings in this case: the first, where the worker logs the
incidents on site. A small resolution is suitable for this, given the cramped environment in which
the worker works, though he will be in high focus (many interactions, complex material, …)







The second setting for your solution is the overview dashboard, which is consulted by an
overseer elsewhere in the facility (not down in the ducts), while the workers are logging the
status of the machinery and possible incidents. S/he can initiate incident response procedures.
This is also an interface which requires high focus.

Wireframe deliverable: Two wireframes, one for the worker logging setting and one for the
dashboard overseer setting.

Example 3: Your concept is a rover rental service. The primary setting is an interface with
features such as vehicle selection, rental dates, etc. A secondary setting also applies, as once
the user is in the vehicle there’s a live “in air” assistant, which projects lifesize (un)docking
instructions, route and other contextual information.

Wireframe deliverable: Two wireframes, one for rental setting and one for the driving setting.

As you see, the actual pixel size of the “screen” is irrelevant, as it can shrink and grow to your
needs. Instead of thinking of size, think of context and setting first and adjust size accordingly.
That is the size you’ll be developing for.


#### User testing reports
Your clickable mockups need to be validated by end users. Therefore, you are required to
perform at least one user test with 4 different users that represent your target users determined
in the personas. A template will be made available to jot down your findings and determine
appropriate scenarios.

A minimum of three scenarios needs to be tested, but you can always include more should you
see fit.


#### Ethical questions
Use the Ethical Decision Making framework to argument at least 2 ethical dilemmas according
to the 5 taught principles including a final conclusion per dilemma.



#### Security risk assessment
Provide a security risk assessment where you identify, assess and give recommendations for
the key controls in your product/applications. The focus should focus on the possible security
defects and vulnerabilities.








#### User flow demonstration
Demonstrate the most important user flows by a screen recording while navigating / using your
visual design. Make as many as are needed and provide them with a clear title.

You may precede the user flow screencast with a short explanation, textual or by means of
graphics / flowcharts / … if you find this necessary.

### Client/server knowledge quiz/exam (D4)
A Leho quiz which tests if you have enough knowledge of the client will be available on the first
day of the first project week. The questions will focus on Vue.js and push notifications from the
input sessions.

On the same day there will be a server exam in which you will need to add some basic features
to the start code of the server in a structured manner. You must use the Gitlab server of TI to
submit. A start repository will be available.

The quiz and exam are individual. More details about the quiz & server exam are on Leho.

### Proof of Concept (D5)
The application contains a web client to handle user interaction and a server to power the back
end.


#### Mandatory requirements for all projects
   1. Coding guidelines: use all good practices from previous and current other courses. Don’t
      forget:
          - Create readable code
          - No redundant code
          - Small functions
          - Functions do 1 thing
          - No duplication
          - Refactor code!

   2. The web client is a Vue.js application. You use Vuetify as UI framework. No other
      Javascript frameworks are permitted. The usage of libraries to extend the functionality
      is permitted, however only limited technical support will be offered when choosing a
      library not offered in the curriculum.

   3. The server is a Java server which uses the vert.x library to provide the necessary
      building blocks for the communication of JSON between both platforms. The startup
      project is written in predefined structure. The student must work in this structure. No





         boilerplate code cannot be removed except for everything todo with the included
         todoApp. No other Java libraries or frameworks are permitted, except by explicit
         confirmation of the group mentor.

   4. A Web API built according to OpenAPI (http) ospecs is mandatory for data exchange
      between client and server.

   5. A SQLite database holds the user collected data.

#### Customisable requirements
Additionally, to the mandatory requirements, you need to implement some other technologies /
principles listed below. Customisation is to fit the needs of your application.

Caution: proper feature integration into product is required! Again, don’t add these as an
afterthought, but as a useful contribution to your product.

You need to complete at least 2 of the class-taught topics and a total of 2 points for the self-
study topics. The level == point worth. (E.g. implementing one level-2 topic == 2 points,
implementing two level-1 topics == 2 points)

Any deviations need to be consolidated with the group mentors.

                      Class-taught topics:
 Push notifications                       Support for notification sent by the server.

 Graphs (Canvas, SVG and/or Chart.js)     Interactive client-side graphs that enable the user to have
                                          an immersive data experience

 Maps (Leaflet)                           Interactive maps via OpenStreetMap which at the very
                                          least use the geolocation feature (which for Adria can
                                          obviously be spoofed). Add markers, routes, area
                                          descriptions… whatever fits your need




                      Self-study topics:
 Level                                     Topics

 Level-1                                       -    Native drag ‘n drop
 Small enhancements                            -    History API
                                               -    Fullscreen API
                                               -    Vibration API
                                               -    Sensor APIs (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity
                                                    sensor, ambient light sensor...)






 Level-2                                       -   CSS animations (consistent across all pages and
 Useful features                                   components, not just a single animation!)
                                               -   MediaStream ImageCapture API
                                               -   Connected hardware via IoT (e.g. raspberry PI, …)




#### Server side tests
Testing is not optional. There should be no need to fire up the client to test your code!
Only test the application layer and domain layer.

Develop the tests as you’re writing the code. Adding them as an afterthought is pointless and
waste of valuable resources... As usual, we will be integrating SonarQube for automated code
quality checks, for client as well as server code.

Aim for a server-side code coverage of > 95%
A levels for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells on both client and server side.
Duplication should always be below 2%.


#### Bonus grades
Projects who go the extra mile will be awarded bonus points. This is a scoring measure that is
applied on top of the already existing score, ignoring any penalties that may be in effect.

Bonus grades will not be quantified beforehand, as they strongly depend on the level of
implementation (detail and quality). The exact amount will be determined ad hoc.

We’ll be allocating bonus grades for:

   -   Teams who manage to get their POCs to work together (by using OpenAPI spec
       integration or based on the asyncAPI spec)
   -   Usefully implemented client side testing
   -   Awesome factor

#### POC scope determination
At the end of week 5, you’ll need to submit a POC scope suggestion by means of a feature list
proposal. The jury will help you align objectives and definitively set the scope for the POC.
During development, always consult with your group mentors to modify the POC scope, wider or
more narrow.

No modifications to the scope are allowed without the explicit consent of the group mentors!








#### Publicly accessible API
Document your publicly accessible API according to the OpenAPI . These will be taught in the
“Information Systems” module.

Remember that you are documenting the entirety of the concept here. The objective is to consider
which aspects of your solution you will expose to the public and how. Not all endpoints or
channels written in the API Spec will be implemented. The implemented end points depend on the
POC scope.

Unimplemented endpoints will automatically be documented as ‘not implemented’ when using
the openAPI spec (https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web-openapi/java/#_not_implemented_error). For
asyncAPI specs, for messages that are not implemented in the POC the payload in the spec
should state 'not implemented'.




### Project work (D6)

#### PM on Gitlab
All work, communication, deadlines, branching, … needs to be handled on the school’s provided
Gitlab repositories according to the best practices taught in current and past Applied Computer
Sciences classes. If things are rusty, get out your old course material and brush up on your
knowledge in order to comply with our rules.

In the first year, you were handed the milestones (=sprints) and the epics (=user stories). This
year, you will need to create these yourselves in gitlab (on your group level).


#### Daily standups
At the start of each project day, the groups should have a "daily standup". You will discuss the
following allocating an average speaking time of 1 minute per person:

   -   What did I work on previously and what is its state (Finished / still in development)?
   -   Did I experience any difficulties with it? If so, which?
   -   What will I be working on today?
   -   Do I expect any difficulties / will I be needing some help with a certain topic?

A team member with expertise in the element in question can already indicate this and can be
an aid at a later stage.

In the project weeks the daily standups take place every day, during the regular class weeks
every Thursday.




You'll need to submit a summary of your daily standup in the secured part of your site as a blog
post. You can choose to either take notes, or record the standup itself and upload it as a video
in the post. Don’t forget to add a title and every post should also have a ‘picture of the day’ with
all the group members. The post should be published at the latest at 10:30am every project day.

### Retrospections and peer assessments (D7)
We’ll be posting several retrospections and peer assessment assignments via Leho, which need
to be completed.

### Presentation (D8)
Read and apply the guidelines of the semester 2 presentation techniques course "Beter
presenteren, is dat echt nodig?"

   -   Allocated time for the presentation is 20 mins and an additional 10 minutes question time
   -   Your audience consists of potential investors (private and government). Keep this in
       mind!
   -   Your presentation is in English. Questions can be answered in Dutch.
   -   Your presentation has the same look and feel as your application.
   -   You are free to choose which tools used to build the presentation (i.e. you are not limited
       to powerpoint slides). Conveying the story is the primary objective.
   -   You make sure the presentation is clear and only contains information that is relevant
       and interesting for your audience.

A few more tips:

   -   Everyone participates equally in the presentation.
   -   You bring a coherent story and you try to anticipate the audience's questions.
   -   You have a neat appearance, but don't exaggerate: you must still be yourself to some
       extent.
   -   Your attitude is of course very important; this means no ringing cell phone, no chewing
       gum, being polite, enthusiastic, … .
   -   The way in which you address the public is also important! Greet the investors, thank
       them for their attention and calmly answer questions, even if they may be formulated
       rather directly.
   -   You defend your project if you feel it is appropriate. However, when necessary you admit
       you made a mistake or you admit you do not know the answer to a specific question.
       The following sentence is always helpful in this kind of situation: “I have not yet looked at
       the matter from this point of view but that is certainly a valuable suggestion. (Don't
       overuse it ;).
   -   You use your non-verbal communication correctly and efficiently.

The entire group must participate in the planned trial presentations before the Christmas
leave. It goes without saying that your test presentation is structured according to the guidelines
of the semester 2 presentation techniques course.
