# 8. Planning


### Project work planning
    There will be a minimum of 5 sprints (=milestones) during this project.

    You will need to create these milestones YOURSELF for your group in gitlab. Do this
    immediately (at the start of the project).

    You CAN create more (intermediate) sprints if that works better for your group (especially
    during active development) and/or if your coach demands it.

    Every sprint starts and ends on Thursday, project day, unless otherwise specified.

    A summary of the project planning is as follows:

Project work always occurs on Thursday as scheduled on your class roster.
All students from each group are expected to be present at each session (not later than 9am
arriving AND not before 5pm leaving). During the project weeks you work from Monday until
Friday (not later than 9am arriving AND not before 4:30pm leaving).

There are no exceptions! If you have a valid reason to not be present, you need to communicate
this with your group mentor and ask for permission for your absence at least 3 days before the

If there are no input sessions or the session is finished, you are expected to continue working

to communicate this with your group mentors and ask for permission for your absence at least
3 days before the session (except in case of illness or injuries, of course).
