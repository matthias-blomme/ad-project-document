# 3. Deliverables

### What do we expect?
You will be given three repositories on the http://gitlab.ti.howest.be space.

   -   A documentation repository
   -   A client repository
   -   A server repository

These will hold all deliverable content, except for the peer assessments, retrospections and
reflections.

We expect all of the following deliverables:

   -   D1: Business case including financial analysis                      documentation repo
       Document describing in detail how you’ll handle the launch of your first product and how
       you’ll meet solvency requirements. This should be a Google Doc based on the LEHO
       Business Case template document, which you link in the readme of the repo.
       Details on the contents of this document will be handled in the input sessions “Business
       Case and documentation”

   -   D2: Project website                                           documentation repo
       Marketing website showcasing your company and launch product. There is also a blog
       part that contains the daily-standups of your project. Link and admin credentials are
       provided in the readme of the repo.
       This is a Wordpress-site. Details on the contents of this website will be handled in the
       input sessions “Business Case and documentation”

   -   D3: Analysis document                                                   documentation repo
       Document describing in detail the full analysis of your first product. This should be a
       Google Doc based on the LEHO Analysis template document, which you link in the
       readme of the repo.
       All necessary information about the scope of your product (concept / personas / user
       stories / feature list) are provided as well as the schematics (flow charts / C4
       diagrammes /UCD / ERD ….) to describe the project. Clickable wireframes and visual
       designs documenting the extent of the project including user testing reports.
       Use the Ethical Decision Making framework to argument at least 2 ethical dilemmas.
       Finally there should also be security risk assessment where you identify, assess and give
       recommendations for the key controls in your product/applications..
       All this will span the full renege of your concept’s scope, which will be far more extensive
       than the POC implementation thereof. Link this file in the readme of the repo.







   -   D4: Client/server knowledge quiz/exam                                    Leho & exam repo
       Over the course of the first 5 weeks, you will acquire knowledge of both client and server
       basic technologies related to the project through a combination of input sessions,
       knowledge clips, and self-study. In the first project week, you will complete an individual
       quiz/exam to assess their acquired knowledge. This will serve as a foundation, allowing
       you to confidently and smoothly transition into the development phase of the project.

   -   D5: Proof of Concept (POC)                                         client & server repo
       Proof of concept of the software system with a working version of the project. Scope
       determined after approval of feature list proposal.
       Provide also a publicly accessible API documented by an OpenAPI and/or asyncAPI
       spec for consuming your application.

   -   D6: PM work in GitLab and blog                    documentation & client & server repo
       All your project management epics(=user stories)/issues/tasks (both technical and
       otherwise) must be created and assigned in gitlab. You will create at least 6
       milestones/sprints in gitlab (see planning dates) to plan your work and where your
       issues will live.
       Each Team member will log their work time they perform under the correct issue (if it’s >
       15 minutes).
       BLOG – daily standup

   -   D7: Various peer assessments and reflections                                   Leho
       Throughout the course of the year, we will implement various peer assessments and
       reflections. These will be collected on Leho.

   -   D8: Presentation for investors jury
       Final presentation of your work, where you’ll convince a jury to invest in your product.
